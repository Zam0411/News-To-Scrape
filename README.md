# News-To-Scrape

I was not able to deploy properly to Heroku and the news articles were not scraping correctly.
When deployed to heroku https://guarded-lake-11634.herokuapp.com/ I get an application error.

I took a video of what I was able to complete as I was not successful in getting the articles to appear to get them saved as they did not get scraped.
